# Change-Test Failure Mapping Analysis

## Overview
This document maps the relationship between branch changes and test failures, identifying which code changes caused which tests to fail and whether the failures are due to test updates needed or code issues.

## Analysis Summary

### Direct Impact (8 test failures)
**Root Cause**: Changes to `processPaymentIntentStatusUpdated.ts` function signature and return structure

1. **Test Updates Needed (2 tests)**: Tests expecting the old return structure need to be updated to handle the new `{result, eventsToLog}` format
2. **Code Issues (6 tests)**: Schema validation failures due to missing `type` field in payment intent metadata for the discriminated union schema

### Indirect/Unrelated Impact (16 test failures)
**Root Cause**: Customer RLS (Row-Level Security) policy issues that are unrelated to the branch changes

- All 12 customer RLS tests are failing due to database policy issues
- 4 billing portal integration tests are failing due to RLS issues
- These failures existed before the branch changes and are not caused by the anonymous checkout or event tracking features

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Update Test Structure (2 tests)**: Modify tests to expect the new return structure from `processPaymentIntentStatusUpdated`
2. **Fix Schema Validation (6 tests)**: Add missing `type` field to payment intent metadata in test data to match the discriminated union schema requirements

### Separate Investigation Required
1. **Customer RLS Issues**: The 16 RLS-related test failures need separate investigation as they're unrelated to the current branch changes
2. **Database Policy Review**: Review and fix row-level security policies for customer data isolation

### Code Quality Notes
- The anonymous checkout and event tracking changes are working as intended
- The schema validation failures indicate that test data needs to be updated to match the new stricter validation requirements
- The RLS test failures suggest pre-existing database configuration issues
