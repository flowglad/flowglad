Examples:
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Add a package: `bun add <package-name>`
- Run scripts: `bun run <script-name>`
- Build: `bun run build`

```

### ast-grep

You run in an environment where `ast-grep` is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to `ast-grep --lang rust -p '<pattern>'` (or set `--lang` appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like `rg` or `grep` unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.
