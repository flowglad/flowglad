<Info>
  Before proceeding, make sure you've [created a Flowglad
  account](https://app.flowglad.com/sign-up) and added your API keys
  to your environment.
</Info>

<Note>
    Flowglad has an MCP server! It can give your AI coding agents more context with the Flowglad docs. You can add it to your AI coding tool of choice by following the [MCP server documentation](/mcp-server).
</Note>

## 1. Install The Flowglad Package

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun add @flowglad/nextjs
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @flowglad/nextjs
```

```bash npm
npm install @flowglad/nextjs
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Codebase Overview

Flowglad can create a custom integration prompt for each pricing model in your organization.

If you haven't already, you'll need to complete a codebase overview to give Flowglad context about your codebase. You'll be asked to complete this overview when creating a new organization or you can do it later in [settings](https://app.flowglad.com/settings).

Simply copy the overview prompt into your AI coding tool of choice and paste the output into the provided text area in Flowglad. 

## 3. One Shot Integration

To access a pricing model's custom integration prompt, go to your pricing model, click "More Options", click "Integrate", and you'll see the prompt (it may take some time to generate).

You can then copy this prompt into your AI coding tool and it should be able to one shot the integration.
