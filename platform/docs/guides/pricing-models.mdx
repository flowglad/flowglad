## Overview

Flowglad supports flexible pricing models to fit various business needs. This guide explores different pricing patterns with complete example implementations. Each pattern includes a fully functional example project you can reference or fork.

## Example Implementations

### Generation-based Subscription

A hybrid pricing model combining subscriptions, one-time payments, and usage-based billing - perfect for AI-powered applications with variable compute costs.

[Next.js](/guides/nextjs/generation-based-subscription) | [Tanstack Start](/guides/tanstack-start/generation-based-subscription)

**Features:**
- Recurring subscription plans
- One-time credit topups
- Usage-based quotas per plan for resource consumption (e.g., image generation)
- Subscription management

**Use Cases:**
- AI image generation services
- API platforms with consumption-based pricing
- Compute platform with subscription and additional paid usage

### Tiered Usage-Gated Subscription

Tiered subscription plans with usage limits and feature access varying by tier - similar to ChatGPT's pricing model with different quotas and capabilities per plan level.

[Next.js](/guides/nextjs/tiered-usage-gated-subscription) 


**Features:**
- Multiple subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Plus, Pro, Business)
- Feature access controlled by subscription tier
- Usage credit grants that renew monthly
- Multiple usage meters with tier-specific limits

**Use Cases:**
- Freemium SaaS products
- AI chat applications with tiered usage
- Collaboration tools with seat-based pricing

### Usage Limit Subscription

Hybrid subscription model with included usage credits that renew each billing period, plus optional overage billing.

[Next.js](/guides/nextjs/usage-limit-subscription) 

**Features:**
- Base subscription with included usage credits
- Monthly credit renewal on billing cycle
- Optional on-demand credit purchases
- Multiple plans with different usage allowances
- Real-time usage tracking and balance monitoring

**Use Cases:**
- API platforms (like Cursor, Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Analytics platforms with query limits

## Choosing a Pricing Model

### Generation-based / Hybrid Model
Choose this when:
- Costs vary significantly per user action
- You want to offer both subscription and pay-as-you-go options
- Resource consumption is unpredictable
- You need to monetize specific high-cost features

### Tiered Usage-Gated Model
Choose this when:
- You want a clear upgrade path from free to paid
- Different user segments need different feature sets
- Usage patterns are relatively predictable
- You want to gate premium features behind higher tiers

### Usage Limit Model
Choose this when:
- Most users fit within predictable usage ranges
- You want to provide certainty with base subscription pricing
- Power users should pay more for extra usage
- You need flexibility for occasional spikes in usage

## Pricing Configuration

Pricing models can be defined in the Flowglad [dashboard](https://app.flowglad.com/pricing-models).

These models can be stored in a `pricing.yaml` file in your codebase. This file specifies:
- Subscription plans and their prices
- Usage meters and their billing rates
- Feature gates and access rules
- Credit grants and renewal policies

This file can be imported/exported from Flowglad as a source of truth that can be checked into version control.
