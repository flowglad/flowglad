## Key Concepts

This pricing model has no recurring charges. Customers start on a free plan and purchase credit packs when they need them. Credits never expire and are consumed one-by-one as the customer uses your product.

This model works well for products with unpredictable usage patterns or where customers prefer not to commit to a subscription. Common examples include API platforms, AI tools, and marketplace credits.

## Implementation

### Pricing Configuration

The `pricing.yaml` file defines the free plan, usage meter, and credit top-up product. See the [full configuration](https://github.com/flowglad/examples/blob/main/nextjs/pay-as-you-go/pricing.yaml) in the repository.

The key distinction from subscription models: there is no `renewalFrequency: "every_billing_period"`. All credits use `renewalFrequency: "once"`, meaning they persist until consumed.

### Checking Credit Balance

Use `checkUsageBalance` to display remaining credits and determine if the customer can perform actions.

```tsx src/app/home-client.tsx
const billing = useBilling();
const balance = billing.checkUsageBalance('message_credits');

const creditsRemaining = balance?.availableBalance ?? 0;
const hasCredits = creditsRemaining > 0;
```

The balance returns `null` if the customer has never purchased credits. Once they purchase a top-up, it returns an object that includes `availableBalance`.

### Recording Usage

When a customer uses a credit, record the usage event server-side. This decrements their balance.

```ts src/app/api/usage-events/route.ts
const flowgladServer = flowglad(userId);
const billing = await flowgladServer.getBilling();
const subscription = billing.currentSubscriptions?.[0];

await flowgladServer.createUsageEvent({
  subscriptionId: subscription.id,
  priceSlug: 'message_credits',
  amount: 1,
  transactionId: finalTransactionId,
});
```

The `transactionId` parameter ensures idempotency. Generate it client-side before making the request so retries do not double-count usage.

### Purchasing Credits

When customers run out of credits (or want to stock up), let them purchase a top-up.

```tsx src/app/home-client.tsx
const handlePurchaseTopUp = async () => {
  const price = billing.getPrice('message_topup');

  await billing.createCheckoutSession({
    priceId: price.id,
    successUrl: window.location.href,
    cancelUrl: window.location.href,
    quantity: 1,
    autoRedirect: true,
  });
};
```

After successful payment, credits are immediately added to the customer's balance. Call `billing.reload()` to refresh the UI.

### Gating Actions on Credit Balance

Block actions when the customer has no credits remaining.

```tsx src/app/home-client.tsx
<Button
  onClick={handleGenerateMessage}
  disabled={creditsRemaining === 0 || isGenerating}
>
  {isGenerating ? 'Generating...' : 'Generate'}
</Button>
```
