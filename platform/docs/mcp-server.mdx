This guide will show you how to setup the Flowglad MCP server.

<Note>
  Some AI tools don't allow the use of remote MCP servers. While Flowglad only
  has a remote MCP server, we detail a simple workaround below.
</Note>

<Info>You'll need a Flowglad API key to authenticate to the MCP server.</Info>

## Remote Server Setup

The Flowglad MCP server can be found at the following URL:
```bash
https://app.flowglad.com/api/mcp
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cursor" icon="/images/claude.svg">
    Open Cursor's `mcp.json` file through the command palette with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or through Cursor Settings > Tools & MCP and paste in the following under `mcpServers`. Make sure to replace `<FLOWGLAD_API_KEY>` with your Flowglad API key.
    ```json mcp.json 
    "flowglad": {
      "url": "https://app.flowglad.com/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <FLOWGLAD_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claude Code" icon="/images/claude.svg">
    Run the following command:
    ```bash 
    claude mcp add --transport http flowglad https://app.flowglad.com/api/mcp
    ```

    You can check that this worked by first running `claude`, to open Claude Code, and then use the `/mcp` command to see a list of MCP servers, which should now include Flowglad's.

## Local Server Workaround

This workaround uses [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) to allow tools that prohibit the use of remote MCP servers, like Claude Desktop, to utilize Flowglad's remote MCP server.

### 1. Install mcp-proxy

First, you'll need to install the `uv` package manager for Python if you haven't already. Its installation docs can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

After you have `uv` installed, you can find the `mcp-proxy` installation documentation [here](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

After you've installed `mcp-proxy`, run `which mcp-proxy` to print the path of the `mcp-proxy` binary and copy it. We'll need this path in the following steps.

### 2. Add MCP Config to Your Tool

Here's an example of a Claude Desktop config using this workaround.

<Note>Make sure to replace `<MCP_PROXY_PATH>` with the path you got from running `which mcp-proxy` above and `<FLOWGLAD_API_KEY>` with your Flowglad API key.</Note>

```json
"flowglad": {
  "command": "<MCP_PROXY_PATH>",
  "args": [
    "--transport",
    "streamablehttp",
    "-H",
    "Authorization",
    "Bearer <FLOWGLAD_API_KEY>",
    "-H",
    "Accept",
    "application/json, text/event-stream",
    "https://app.flowglad.com/api/mcp"
  ]
}
```
