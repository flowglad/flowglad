Discounts allow you to reduce the price of products and subscriptions for your customers. They can be applied at checkout or via the API.

## Types of Discounts

Flowglad supports two types of discounts based on how the reduction is calculated:

### Percentage Discounts

A percentage reduction off the original price. For example:
- 10% off
- 25% off
- 50% off

### Fixed Amount Discounts

A specific monetary amount deducted from the original price. This amount is stored as an integer (e.g., cents for USD, pence for GBP). For example:
- $10.00 off
- £20.00 off
- €15.50 off

<Note>
Fixed discount amounts are stored in the smallest unit of a given currency, e.g. in cents for USD.

## Creating Discounts

You can create discounts from the [Discounts page](https://app.flowglad.com/finance/discounts) in your dashboard:

1. Click the "New Discount" button.
2. Fill out the discount details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for internal reference (e.g., "Summer Sale 2024").
   - **Code**: The code customers will enter at checkout. Must be between 3 and 20 characters. It will be automatically converted to uppercase (e.g., `SUMMER20`).
   - **Amount Type**: Choose `Percentage` or `Fixed Amount`.
   - **Amount**: The numeric value for the discount (e.g., `10` for 10% or `1000` for $10.00).
   - **Duration**: Specify how long the discount applies, especially for subscriptions (see details below).
   - **Number of Payments**: Only required if `Duration` is set to `Number of Payments`. Specifies how many billing cycles the discount applies to.
   - **Active**: Controls whether the discount code can be redeemed. Defaults to `true`.

## Discount Duration

When creating a discount, particularly for subscriptions, you must specify its duration:

- **Once**: The discount is applied only to the initial payment of a purchase or subscription.
- **Forever**: The discount is applied to all recurring payments for the entire lifetime of the subscription.
- **Number of Payments**: The discount is applied for a specific number of billing periods (e.g., for the first 3 months of a monthly subscription). You must provide the exact number of payments when selecting this option.

## Managing Discounts

From the Discounts page, you can:
- View all your created discount codes.
- See how many times each code has been redeemed.
- Edit the details of existing discounts.
- Toggle the `Active` status to enable or disable codes.
- Delete discounts that haven't been redeemed yet.

<Note>
Deactivating or deleting a discount code that has already been applied to active subscriptions will **not** remove the discount from those existing subscriptions. They will continue as per the original discount's terms.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- Use clear, memorable, and relatively short discount codes.
- Deactivate promotional codes once the promotion ends.
- Consider the financial impact of `Forever` discounts on subscription revenue.
- Monitor discount usage patterns to inform future promotions.
- Always test your discount codes in a staging or test environment before sharing them publicly.

<Tip>
Create unique discount codes for different marketing campaigns or channels (e.g., `NEWSLETTER10`, `PODCAST15`) to track their performance effectively.
