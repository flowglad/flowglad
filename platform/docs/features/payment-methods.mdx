# Payment Methods

Payment Methods represent the ways your customers have on file to pay you, such as credit cards or US bank accounts. Flowglad securely stores and manages this information, linking it directly to your `Customer` records.

## How Payment Methods are Added

Customers can add payment methods in a few primary ways:

1.  **During Checkout:** When a customer completes a checkout session for a subscription or a one-time purchase (using `CheckoutSessionType.Product` or `CheckoutSessionType.Purchase`), the payment method used is typically saved automatically to their customer record.
2.  **Explicitly Adding a Method:** You can allow customers to add a payment method without an immediate purchase. This is done using a specific type of checkout session: `CheckoutSessionType.AddPaymentMethod`. This is useful for:
    *   Setting up future payments.
    *   Allowing customers to add a payment method via an embedded billing page or a hosted customer portal (which would utilize this checkout session type behind the scenes).

## The "Add Payment Method" Checkout Session

This specialized checkout session (`CheckoutSessionType.AddPaymentMethod`) is designed solely to capture and save a customer's payment details.

*   **Targeting Subscriptions:** When creating this session (e.g., using the `FlowgladServer.createAddPaymentMethodCheckoutSession` method), you can optionally provide a `targetSubscriptionId`. If provided, the newly added payment method will automatically become the default payment method for that specific subscription. This is ideal for scenarios like:
    *   Free trials where a payment method is required to continue service post-trial.
    *   Subscriptions created initially without payment, requiring the customer to add one later.

## Stored Information

Each `PaymentMethod` record stores important details:

*   **`type`**: The kind of payment method, such as `PaymentMethodType.Card` or `PaymentMethodType.USBankAccount`.
*   **`billingDetails`**: An object containing the customer's billing address (name, email, address).
*   **`paymentMethodData`**: Specific details about the payment method itself, which vary by type. For cards, this includes `brand` (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) and `last4` digits. For US bank accounts, it includes `last4`. Flowglad provides helpers like `paymentMethodSummaryLabel` to easily display this information (e.g., "Visa ending in 1234").
*   **`default`**: A boolean indicating if this is the default payment method for the associated `Customer`.

## Importance for Fees

The `type` of the payment method is crucial for accurately calculating payment processing fees, as different methods (e.g., cards vs. bank accounts) often incur different fee structures.
