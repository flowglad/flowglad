Products allow you to group features together to form an offering your customers can purchase or subscribe to. Every product must be attached to exactly one pricing model and has one active price at a time.

# Creating Products

You can see and create products from your pricing model details page.

## General Information

When creating a product, you'll need to provide some basic information:

- **Name**: A clear, descriptive name for your product
- **Description**: (Optional but recommended) A detailed explanation of what the product offers
- **Pricing Model**: Every product must be attached to exactly one pricing model
- **Features** (for non-usage price types): The features included in this product that will be granted when a customer successfully subscribes to or purchases it
- **Price**: The type of the price (single payment, subscription, or usage) and relevant details such as amount, billing interval, etc. Note: the price type for a product cannot be changed later for billing stability. Other details can be modified.

### About Pricing Models
<Note>
Pricing Models group your products and prices, along with associated features and usage meters. Pricing models schematize your business model. This allows you to iterate on your pricing easily, clone new pricing strategies from test mode to live mode, or import pricing strategies via templates
</Note>

This is particularly useful when you need to:

- Support different pricing schemes for different user communities
- Migrate prices without affecting existing customers
- Keep your pricing structure organized and manageable

By isolating products into specific pricing models, you can maintain a clean and organized pricing structure without cluttering your global product space.

## Pricing

When creating a product, you'll need to set up an initial price which becomes the default price for that product. This default price is what customers see during checkout and what the API returns as the product's default price.

A few important notes about pricing:

- The initial price you create will automatically be set as the default
- Once created, the pricing type of the price you created cannot be modified
- You can change the price for this product and the new price will automatically be set as the default price
- A product can only have one active price at a time. Once a new price is created, the previous active price is deactivated

## Media

You can include an image on a product or attach an image to a product and this will be used on the checkout page for the product as well as visible on the product details page or the products table.
