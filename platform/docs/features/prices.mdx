Prices are where the important billing and monetary information in your catalog lives. They belong to products and come in distinct types that enable different billing behaviors.

## Price Types

Flowglad supports three types of prices, each serving different billing needs:

### Single Payment Prices

The simplest form of pricing - a one-time payment (`unitPrice`) for a product or service. These prices do not have recurring intervals, trial periods, or setup fees.

### Subscription Prices

Enable recurring revenue by charging a fixed amount (`unitPrice`) on a set interval. These prices have:

- **Interval Unit**: The time unit for billing (e.g., `month`, `year`). Required.
- **Interval Count**: How many units between billings (e.g., `1` for monthly, `3` for quarterly). Required. Defaults to 1, but configurable in the [create](/api-reference/prices/create-price) and [update](/api-reference/prices/update-price) prices API endpoints.
- **Trial Period Days** (optional): How long to run a free trial after checkout before the first charge.

### Usage Prices

For billing based on actual usage of your product or service, charged on a recurring interval. Key characteristics:

- Associated with a specific [usage meter](/features/usage). Required via `usageMeterId`.
- Usage charges are typically calculated and billed at the end of the billing period (based on `intervalUnit` and `intervalCount`), unlike standard subscriptions which charge at the start.
- **Usage Events Per Unit**: How many usage events are considered one unit to be charged at the unit price. Required.
- Any usage price can be set as the **default price** for its usage meter. When usage events are created using a meter identifier (`usageMeterSlug` or `usageMeterId`), the system resolves to this default price.
- Every usage meter has an auto-generated [no-charge price](/features/usage#no-charge-prices) (`{usagemeterslug}_no_charge`) that serves as the fallback default.

<Tip>
Usage meter prices combine recurring billing cycles with variable charges based on consumption tracked by a usage meter.

## Default Price

### Product Default Price

Each product has a default price. This is the price presented by default in checkouts or API calls when a specific price isn't requested.

- Only one price per product can be the default active price at any time. If you set a new price as the default (either on creation or by updating), any existing default price for that product will automatically have its `isDefault` flag set to `false`.

### Usage Meter Default Price

Usage meters also have default prices, separate from product default prices. This determines which price is used when creating usage events via `usageMeterSlug` or `usageMeterId`.

- Every usage meter has a guaranteed default price—either a price you've configured or the auto-generated [no-charge price](/features/usage#no-charge-prices).
- If you unset the current default price for a usage meter, the no-charge price automatically becomes the default.
- The `_no_charge` slug suffix is reserved for these auto-generated prices and cannot be used for user-created prices.

## Choosing the Right Price Type

Your choice of price type impacts how and when your customers are billed:

- Use **Single Payment** for one-off purchases.
- Use **Subscription** for predictable recurring revenue charged at the start of each period.
- Use **Usage Meter** for recurring billing cycles where the amount charged reflects actual consumption during the period, typically billed at the end.

## Creating a Price

Prices are first created when you create a product from the pricing model page. 

You can then update the price from the edit button for the product on the pricing model page by:

1. Selecting a product
2. Clicking the "New Price" button
3. Filling out the price details form

When creating a price, you'll need to provide:

- **Unit Price**: The amount to charge (in cents/pence)
- **Type**: Choose between Single Payment, Subscription, or Usage Meter

Additional fields will appear based on the price type selected:

- For **Subscription** prices:
  - Interval Unit (month/year)
  - Optional Trial Period Days

- For **Usage** prices:
  - Usage Meter selection
  - Usage Events Per Unit
