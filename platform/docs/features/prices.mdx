# Prices

Prices are where the important billing and monetary information in your catalog lives. They belong to products and come in distinct types that enable different billing behaviors.

## Price Types

Flowglad supports three types of prices, each serving different billing needs:

### Single Payment Prices

The simplest form of pricing - a one-time payment (`unitPrice`) for a product or service. These prices do not have recurring intervals, trial periods, or setup fees.

### Subscription Prices

Enable recurring revenue by charging a fixed amount (`unitPrice`) on a set interval. These prices have:

- **Interval Unit**: The time unit for billing (e.g., `month`, `year`). Required.
- **Interval Count**: How many units between billings (e.g., `1` for monthly, `3` for quarterly). Required.
- **Trial Period Days** (optional): How long to run a free trial after checkout before the first charge.
- **Setup Fee Amount** (optional): A one-time fee charged at the beginning of the subscription.

### Usage Meter Prices

For billing based on actual usage of your product or service, charged on a recurring interval. Key characteristics:

- Associated with a specific [usage meter](/features/usage-meters). Required via `usageMeterId`.
- Usage charges are typically calculated and billed at the end of the billing period (based on `intervalUnit` and `intervalCount`), unlike standard subscriptions which charge at the start.
- **Interval Unit**: The time unit for the billing cycle (e.g., `month`). Required.
- **Interval Count**: How many units define the billing cycle length. Required.
- **Setup Fee Amount** (optional): A one-time fee charged at the beginning of the subscription.
- **Trial Period Days**: Not applicable for usage-based prices.

<Tip>
Usage meter prices combine recurring billing cycles with variable charges based on consumption tracked by a usage meter.

## Default Price

Each product has a default price. This is the price presented by default in checkouts or API calls when a specific price isn't requested.

- You can mark a price as the default by setting its `isDefault` flag to `true`.
- Only one price per product can be the default at any time. If you set a new price as the default (either on creation or by updating), any existing default price for that product will automatically have its `isDefault` flag set to `false`.
- If no price for a product is explicitly marked as default (`isDefault: true`), the system considers the *first price ever created* for that product to be the default.

## Choosing the Right Price Type

Your choice of price type impacts how and when your customers are billed:

- Use **Single Payment** for one-off purchases.
- Use **Subscription** for predictable recurring revenue charged at the start of each period.
- Use **Usage Meter** for recurring billing cycles where the amount charged reflects actual consumption during the period, typically billed at the end.

## Creating a Price

You can create prices from the [Products page](https://app.flowglad.com/store/products) by:

1. Selecting a product
2. Clicking the "Add Price" button
3. Filling out the price details form

When creating a price, you'll need to provide:

- **Unit Price**: The amount to charge (in cents/pence)
- **Currency**: The currency for this price (e.g., USD, GBP, EUR)
- **Type**: Choose between Single Payment, Subscription, or Usage Meter
- **Default**: Whether this should be the default price for the product

Additional fields will appear based on the price type selected:

- For **Subscription** prices:
  - Interval Unit (month/year)
  - Interval Count
  - Optional Trial Period Days
  - Optional Setup Fee

- For **Usage** prices:
  - Usage Meter selection
  - Interval Unit (month/year)
  - Interval Count
  - Optional Setup Fee
