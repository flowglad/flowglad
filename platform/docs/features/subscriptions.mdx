Subscriptions represent an ongoing payment relationship with your customer. Flowglad provides a robust subscription model with carefully considered defaults to handle common billing scenarios effectively.

## What is a Subscription?

A Subscription in Flowglad tracks the details of a recurring charge for a customer, including what products or services they're paying for, how often, and their current status.

Key concepts:
*   **Customers are always on a subscription, even if they aren't paying:** when a customer is created, they are subscribed to the **default plan** for their [pricing model](/features/pricing-models). If they purchase a subscription product while they are currently subscribed to your pricing model's free plan, their current subscription will change to be attached to the new price.
*   **One Current Subscription per Customer (Default):** By default, a customer can only have one active subscription at a time (see "Current vs Non-Current Subscriptions" below). This encourages simpler billing management. If you need customers to have multiple simultaneous subscriptions, you can enable the `allow_multiple_subscriptions_per_customer` setting at the organization level in your dashboard [settings page](https://app.flowglad.com/settings).
*   **Billing Cycle Anchor Date:** The `billingCycleAnchorDate` (set from the `startDate` on creation) determines the day of the month billing occurs. If this date doesn't exist in a given month (e.g., the 31st in February), billing occurs on the last day of that month.
*   **Billing Periods:** Defined by the `startDate`, `interval` (e.g., `Month`, `Year`), and `intervalCount`. Flowglad automatically calculates the `currentBillingPeriodStart` and `currentBillingPeriodEnd` for each cycle.

## Subscription Structure

Each `Subscription` record has one or more `SubscriptionItem` records.

*   **`Subscription` Record:** Holds the core details like the customer (`customerId`), overall status, billing cycle information (`interval`, `intervalCount`, `billingCycleAnchorDate`), trial period (`trialEnd`), and potentially default/backup payment methods. It also has a primary `priceId` which often corresponds to the initial item purchased. But note: the `SubscriptionItem`s define the actual billing components.
*   **`SubscriptionItem` Record:** Represents a specific product or service line item within the subscription. Each item has its own `priceId`, `quantity`, and `unitPrice`. This allows for subscriptions with multiple components, potentially added or changed over time. The sum of active subscription items determines the amount billed each period (for non-usage-based items).

### Current vs Non-Current Subscriptions
Depending on its status, a subscription can either be **current** or not. A current subscription will grant feature access and usage credits. A non-current subscription will not.
Current subscriptions have one of the following statuses:
- `"active"`
- `"past_due"`
- `"trialing"`
- `"cancellation_scheduled"`
- `"unpaid"`

Subscriptions in all other statuses will be inactive.

## Creating a Subscription

There are two primary ways to create a subscription:

### 1. Via Checkout Session

Customers can initiate subscriptions themselves by completing a checkout session for a product with a `subscription` type price.

*   **How:** This can be done through hosted product/price purchase pages or programmatically using the [`useBilling()` hook's `createCheckoutSession` method](/features/checkout-sessions#using-usebilling-hook).
*   **Use Case:** Standard customer sign-ups and purchases where the customer interacts directly with a checkout flow initiated from within the product
*   **Payment Method:** Checkout Sessions typically require collecting payment details (unless a trial is offered).

  Learn more about setting up checkouts in the [Checkout Sessions documentation](/features/checkout-sessions).

### 2. Via API

You can programmatically create subscriptions using the [API endpoint](/api-reference/subscriptions/create-subscription)

*   **How:** Requires providing `customerId`, `priceId`, `startDate`, `interval`, and `intervalCount`.
*   **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where you create subscriptions automatically based on actions within your application, such as user sign-up, plan changes initiated within your UI, or migrations.
*   **Payment Method:** Creating subscriptions via the API **does not** require a `defaultPaymentMethodId` or `backupPaymentMethodId`. This is useful for starting customers on free trials without asking for card details upfront. The subscription status will initially be `Incomplete` if `autoStart` is false and there's no trial or payment method. It becomes `Trialing` if a `trialEnd` date is provided, or `Active` if `autoStart` is true and a default payment method exists for the customer or is provided.

## Subscription Lifecycle & Billing

Subscriptions transition through various statuses and billing cycles over their lifetime.

### Statuses

A subscription can be in one of several states (`SubscriptionStatus`):

*   **`Trialing`:** Active during a free trial period. Considered a "current" subscription.
*   **`Active`:** The standard state for a paying, up-to-date subscription. Considered "current".
*   **`PastDue`:** Payment failed, but Flowglad may retry. Considered "current".
*   **`Unpaid`:** Payment failed after retries; requires manual intervention or updated payment method. Considered "current".
*   **`Incomplete`:** Created but needs setup (e.g., payment method added) before becoming active. Not "current".
*   **`IncompleteExpired`:** A related Checkout Session expired before completion. Not "current".
*   **`CancellationScheduled`:** Will be canceled at a future date (usually the end of the current billing period). Considered "current" until the cancellation date.
*   **`Canceled`:** The subscription has ended and is no longer active. Not "current".

You can check if a subscription is in any of the "current" states (`Active`, `PastDue`, `Trialing`, `CancellationScheduled`, `Unpaid`) using helper functions or by checking the status directly.

### Billing Periods & Transitions

At the end of each `currentBillingPeriodEnd`, a transition occurs:
1.  A new billing period is calculated based on the anchor date, interval, and interval count.
2.  For upcoming charges, a `BillingRun` is generated.

### Charging Behavior

*   **`runBillingAtPeriodStart`:** This boolean field on the `Subscription` determines *when* the charge for a billing period is attempted.
    *   **Default for `subscription` Price Type:** `true`. Charges are typically attempted at the *start* of the billing period (e.g., paying for the upcoming month).
    *   **Default for `usage` Price Type:** `false`. Charges are attempted at the *end* of the billing period after usage for that period has been recorded.
*   **Overrides:** This default behavior can be overridden when creating or updating the subscription if needed.

## Canceling a Subscription

Flowglad offers flexibility in how subscriptions can be canceled.

### Cancellation Options

*   **Immediately:** The subscription is canceled right away. Proration logic may apply depending on your settings (though explicit proration controls are still evolving).
*   **At End of Current Billing Period:** The subscription remains active until the `currentBillingPeriodEnd`, at which point it transitions to `Canceled`. The status becomes `CancellationScheduled` until then.
*   **At a Future Date (Coming Soon):** Functionality to cancel on a specific arbitrary date in the future is planned.

### Methods for Cancellation

1.  **Flowglad Dashboard:** Manually cancel subscriptions directly within the Flowglad UI.
2.  **API:** Programmatically cancel subscriptions using the [API endpoint](/api-reference/subscriptions/cancel-subscription) or SDK methods ([client](/sdks/react#cancelsubscription), [server](/sdks/server#cancelsubscription)).
3.  **Customer Self-Service:** Allow customers to manage their own subscriptions.
    *   **Hosted Billing Portal:** (available for livemode customers only) A no-code option accessible via a unique URL for your organization. The `billingPortalUrl` is returned in customer billing details from `useBilling` or the [get billing details API](/api-reference/customer/get-billing-details). It can also be found in the customer details page in your Flowglad dashboard.
    *   **Headless Implementation:** Use the `useBilling()` hook's `cancelSubscription` function (ensure it's used within a `<FlowgladProvider>` context) to build a completely custom cancellation UI.

## Uncanceling a Subscription

If a subscription has been scheduled for cancellation (status `cancellation_scheduled`), you can reverse the cancellation before it takes effect. This restores the subscription to its previous state (either `active` or `trialing`) and ensures billing will continue as normal.

### When Uncancel is Available

Uncancel is available for subscriptions that have a **scheduled cancellation** (status `cancellation_scheduled`). This typically happens when you cancel a subscription with the "At End of Current Billing Period" option.
Once a subscription is immediately canceled (status `canceled`), it cannot be uncanceled. A new subscription would need to be created.

For paid subscriptions, a valid payment method must exist for the subscription. For free subscriptions, no payment method is required.

### Methods for Uncanceling

*   **[React SDK](/sdks/react#uncancelsubscription):** Use the `uncancelSubscription` method from the `useBilling()` hook for client-side implementation
*   **[Server SDK](/sdks/server#uncancelsubscription):** Use the `uncancelSubscription` method from `FlowgladServer` for server-side implementation
*   **[API](/api-reference/subscriptions/uncancel-subscription):** Make a POST request to `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/uncancel`

See the SDK documentation for detailed code examples.
