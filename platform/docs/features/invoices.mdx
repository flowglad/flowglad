Invoices in Flowglad serve as detailed records justifying payments made by your customers. They provide a clear breakdown of charges, whether for recurring subscriptions, one-time purchases, or manually created bills.

## How Invoices are Generated

Invoices are created in several ways within Flowglad:

1.  **Subscription Renewals:** An invoice is automatically generated for each billing cycle of an active subscription. It reflects the charges for that period based on the subscription plan.
2.  **One-Time Purchases:** When a customer completes a checkout for a non-subscription product or service, an invoice is generated and typically marked as paid immediately upon successful payment.
3.  **Manual Creation (UI):** You can create invoices directly from the Customer Details page in the Flowglad dashboard. This is useful for bespoke charges, consultations, or services not tied to a standard product or subscription.
4.  **Manual Creation (API):** Invoices can be programmatically created using the Flowglad API.

    ```typescript title="API: Create Invoice Example"
    // Simplified example using a hypothetical SDK
    const { invoice, invoiceLineItems } = await flowglad.invoices.create({
      invoice: {
        customerId: 'cust_123',
        currency: 'USD',
        //dueDate: new Date('2024-12-31'), // Optional, defaults to issue date
        // invoiceNumber: 'INV-CUST-001' // Optional, can be assigned
      },
      invoiceLineItems: [
        {
          description: 'Consulting Services',
          quantity: 2,
          price: 50000, // Price in cents (e.g., $500.00)
        },
        {
          description: 'Setup Fee',
          quantity: 1,
          price: 10000, // $100.00
        },
      ],
      autoSend: true, // Optional: Email invoice to customer upon creation
    });
    ```

## Invoice Structure & Line Items

Each invoice contains essential details like the issue date, due date, customer information, and potentially billing/shipping addresses.

A key part of the invoice is its **Line Items**. When creating invoices manually (via UI or API):

*   Line items detail specific goods or services being charged for.
*   Each line item includes a `description`, `quantity`, and `price` (per unit, specified in the currency's smallest unit, e.g., cents for USD).
*   Line items can be entirely custom; they **do not** need to be linked to a pre-existing Product or Price record in Flowglad (the `priceId` field is optional).

## Paying Invoices

*   **Automatic Payment:** Invoices generated for subscriptions are automatically paid when the corresponding subscription payment is successfully processed. Similarly, invoices for one-time purchases are settled upon checkout completion.
*   **Manual Payment:** Manually created invoices (or overdue subscription invoices) can be paid by the customer through a dedicated, secure checkout session. When you create or send an invoice, Flowglad can generate a unique payment link. Clicking this link takes the customer to a checkout page specifically for settling that invoice.

## Invoices vs. Payments

Think of an Invoice as the "why" and a Payment as the "how" and "when".

*   **Invoice:** Details *what* a customer owes and *why* (e.g., Subscription renewal for Plan X, Consulting Services). It's the bill or statement of charges.
*   **Payment:** Represents the actual transaction where funds were transferred to settle an invoice (or part of it).

Every payment processed through Flowglad is linked to an invoice (`invoiceId`) to maintain a clear audit trail.

## Invoice Numbering

Each invoice has a unique `invoiceNumber`. While you can assign specific numbers via the API during creation, Flowglad ensures uniqueness for tracking purposes.

## Invoice Statuses

An invoice progresses through various statuses during its lifecycle:

*   `draft`: The invoice is being created and is not yet finalized or sent.
*   `open`: The invoice has been finalized and issued to the customer, awaiting payment.
*   `paid`: The invoice has been fully paid.
*   `uncollectible`: The invoice is deemed unlikely to be paid and has been written off.
*   `void`: The invoice has been cancelled before payment and is no longer valid.
*   `refunded`: The full amount of a paid invoice has been refunded. (Note: `fully_refunded` might be used internally)
*   `partially_refunded`: A portion of a paid invoice has been refunded.
*   `awaiting_payment_confirmation`: Payment has been initiated but is pending final confirmation (e.g., for certain bank transfer methods).

## Receipts

Once an invoice is marked as `paid`, Flowglad automatically generates a corresponding Receipt. This serves as proof of payment for the customer and references the original invoice details. Both invoices and receipts can be viewed and downloaded as PDFs.

## Other API Operations

Besides creation, the Invoices API allows you to:

*   **Retrieve (`GET`):** Fetch details of a specific invoice and its line items.
*   **List (`LIST`):** Retrieve a list of invoices, with pagination and filtering options.
*   **Update (`PUT`):** Modify details of an existing invoice (primarily `draft` invoices, though some fields on `open` invoices might be updatable depending on configuration).
*   **Send Reminder:** Trigger an email reminder to the customer for an `open` invoice.
