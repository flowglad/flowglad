## Welcome

This is the API reference for the Flowglad API! We highly recommend using our SDKs to interact with the API. Our API is in active development, and as such, is frequently updated, occasionally with breaking changes. However, if you need to interact with API resources directly, this is the place to be.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Set them in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_.......
```

## REST Library

In the case that you need to interact with the REST API directly, the easiest way is to install `@flowglad/node`:

```bash
bun add @flowglad/node
```

This will give you a `Flowglad` class that you can use to interact with the API.

```ts
import { Flowglad } from '@flowglad/node'
const flowglad = new Flowglad({
  apiKey: 'sk_test_.......',
  // or set your FLOWGLAD_SECRET_KEY environment variable
})
```
