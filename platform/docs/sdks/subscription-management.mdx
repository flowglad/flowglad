## Overview

Use Flowglad to create, update, and cancel subscriptions across web and server experiences. This page outlines recommended patterns for keeping customer access in sync with billing status.

## What you'll learn

- Create subscriptions server-side using the Flowglad Server SDK.
- Trigger cancellations from server or client flows with the appropriate guardrails.
- Sync subscription state to your application for entitlement checks.

## Next steps

- Implement the `createSubscription` sample mutation in your backend.
- Use the React or Next.js SDK hooks to surface cancellation controls in-app.
