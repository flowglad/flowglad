## Overview

Flowglad tracks feature entitlements and consumption so you can gate premium functionality or enforce usage-based plans. Learn how to validate access before rendering protected experiences.

## What you'll learn

- Query feature access using the client SDK billing hooks.
- Fetch usage balances for metered features and display remaining quota.
- Combine entitlement checks with subscription state for robust authorization logic.

## Next steps

- Add `checkFeatureAccess` to your frontend guard logic.
- Use `getUsageBalance` server-side to power proactive notifications.
