## Choosing the Right SDK

### For Next.js Applications

Use **@flowglad/nextjs** - it includes everything you need:
- Server-side utilities for Flowglad API routes and direct server methods
- Client-side React context for managing billing and subscription data
- Support for both App Router and Pages Router

### For Other React Frameworks

Use **@flowglad/react** + **@flowglad/server**:
- @flowglad/react handles billing and subscription state in your React frontend
- @flowglad/server provides the Flowglad server instance your frontend communicates with

### For Express Backends

Use **@flowglad/express**:
- @flowglad/express provides Express router for Flowglad REST endpoints

### For Other Node.js Backends

Use **@flowglad/server** directly for maximum flexibility
