        <>
          You do not need to build webhook handlers or any glue code to keep entitlements in sync with your customer's billing state according to your payment provider. Flowglad handles the webhook-driven state transitions internally and exposes the latest derived state via our SDK.

        <>
          For most cases, yes. Webhooks are still useful if you need to trigger background jobs and event-driven workflows, such as shutting down a customer's server in response to them cancelling their plan. Flowglad's goal is that entitlement checks and billing-state reads do not require you to run your own webhook pipeline.
