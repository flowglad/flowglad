# 5 Subscription Metrics Every SaaS Founder Should Track

Running a subscription business without tracking the right metrics is like driving blindfolded. You might move fast, but you have no idea where you're going or if you're about to crash.

After helping hundreds of SaaS companies implement billing and analytics, we've identified the 5 most critical metrics every founder should obsess over.

## 1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**What it is**: The predictable revenue your business generates each month from subscriptions.

**Why it matters**: MRR is your business's heartbeat. It shows your growth trajectory and helps you forecast future revenue.

**How to calculate**:
```
MRR = Number of Customers Ã— Average Revenue Per User
```

**Pro tip**: Track MRR movement, not just absolute numbers. Break it down into:
- New MRR (from new customers)  
- Expansion MRR (from upgrades)
- Churned MRR (from lost customers)
- Contraction MRR (from downgrades)

## 2. Customer Churn Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period.

**Why it matters**: Churn is the silent killer of SaaS businesses. Even small improvements in churn can have massive impacts on long-term growth.

**How to calculate**:
```
Monthly Churn Rate = (Customers Lost in Month) Ã· (Customers at Start of Month) Ã— 100
```

**Benchmarks**:
- Early stage (< $1M ARR): 10-15% monthly churn is normal
- Growth stage ($1M-10M ARR): Aim for 5-7% monthly churn  
- Scale stage (> $10M ARR): Target < 5% monthly churn

## 3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**What it is**: The total revenue you can expect from a customer over their entire relationship with your business.

**Why it matters**: LTV helps you understand how much you can afford to spend acquiring customers and which customer segments are most valuable.

**Simple calculation**:
```
LTV = Average Revenue Per User Ã· Monthly Churn Rate
```

**Example**: If your ARPU is $100/month and churn is 5%, your LTV is $2,000.

## 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**What it is**: The average cost to acquire a new paying customer.

**Why it matters**: CAC tells you if your growth is sustainable. If it costs more to acquire a customer than they're worth, you're in trouble.

**How to calculate**:
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Expenses Ã· Number of New Customers Acquired
```

**The Golden Ratio**: Aim for an LTV:CAC ratio of at least 3:1. This means each customer should be worth at least 3x what you spend to acquire them.

## 5. Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**What it is**: Measures how much revenue you retain and grow from existing customers, including upgrades, downgrades, and churn.

**Why it matters**: NRR is the best predictor of long-term success. Companies with high NRR grow faster and are more valuable.

**How to calculate**:
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR - Contraction MRR) Ã· Starting MRR Ã— 100
```

**Benchmarks**:
- < 90%: Major retention problem
- 90-100%: Room for improvement  
- 100-110%: Good retention
- > 110%: Excellent retention (your existing customers are growing your business)

## Red Flags to Watch For

ðŸš¨ **MRR growth slowing**: Could indicate market saturation or product issues  
ðŸš¨ **Churn increasing**: Usually the first sign of product-market fit problems  
ðŸš¨ **LTV decreasing**: Customers aren't sticking around as long  
ðŸš¨ **CAC increasing**: Your acquisition channels are becoming less efficient  
ðŸš¨ **NRR below 100%**: You're losing revenue from existing customers  

## Taking Action

Metrics are only valuable if they drive action. Here's what to do:

1. **Set up automated reporting**: Get weekly metric summaries sent to your team
2. **Establish benchmarks**: Know what good looks like for your business stage
3. **Investigate changes**: When metrics move significantly, dig into why
4. **Run experiments**: Use metrics to test improvements to your product and processes

## The Bottom Line

These 5 metrics will give you a clear picture of your subscription business health. Focus on improving them consistently, and you'll build a stronger, more valuable company.

Remember: it's better to track a few metrics well than many metrics poorly. Start with these 5, get them right, then expand your analytics as needed.
