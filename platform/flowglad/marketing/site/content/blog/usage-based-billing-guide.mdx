# The Complete Guide to Usage-Based Billing

Usage-based billing is becoming increasingly popular among SaaS companies, and for good reason. Instead of fixed monthly fees, customers pay for exactly what they use - making your product more accessible to small customers while allowing power users to scale naturally.

## What is Usage-Based Billing?

Usage-based billing, also known as consumption-based pricing, charges customers based on their actual usage of your product or service. Think of how AWS charges for compute time, or how Stripe charges per transaction.

### Common Usage Metrics

- **API Calls**: Perfect for developer-focused products
- **Storage**: Great for file hosting or backup services  
- **Bandwidth**: Ideal for CDNs or media streaming
- **Processing Time**: Perfect for compute-intensive tasks
- **Active Users**: Good for team-based collaboration tools

## Benefits of Usage-Based Billing

### 1. Lower Barrier to Entry
New customers can start small without committing to expensive monthly plans. This significantly improves conversion rates from free trials.

### 2. Natural Growth
As customers grow their business, their usage (and payments) grow naturally with it. This creates a strong alignment between your success and theirs.

### 3. Fair Pricing
Customers only pay for what they actually use, making your product feel more valuable and fair.

### 4. Higher Revenue Potential
Power users will naturally pay more as they use more, often exceeding what they would pay on a flat monthly plan.

## Implementation with Flowglad

Implementing usage-based billing with Flowglad is straightforward:

```typescript
import { trackUsage } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

// Track an API call
await trackUsage({
  customerId: user.id,
  eventName: 'api_call',
  quantity: 1,
  metadata: {
    endpoint: '/api/users',
    method: 'GET'
  }
})
```

### Setting Up Usage Metrics

1. **Define Your Metrics**: Decide what you want to charge for
2. **Track Usage**: Use our SDK to track usage events in real-time
3. **Set Pricing Tiers**: Configure pricing per unit in the Flowglad dashboard
4. **Handle Billing**: We automatically calculate bills based on usage

## Best Practices

### Start Simple
Don't try to track everything. Start with one or two key metrics that directly correlate with the value you provide.

### Provide Usage Visibility  
Always show customers their current usage and projected costs. Transparency builds trust.

### Set Usage Limits
Implement soft and hard limits to prevent bill shock. Flowglad supports automatic limit enforcement.

### Offer Prepaid Credits
Some customers prefer predictable costs. Offer prepaid credit packages for volume discounts.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Tracking too many metrics**: This creates confusion and complexity  
❌ **Not providing usage visibility**: Customers hate surprise bills  
❌ **Ignoring edge cases**: What happens when usage spikes unexpectedly?  
❌ **Complex pricing models**: Keep it simple and understandable  

## Real-World Examples

**Twilio** charges per SMS/call/email sent - simple and directly tied to value  
**Vercel** charges for function execution time and bandwidth used  
**OpenAI** charges per API token processed  

Each of these models is easy to understand and directly correlates with the value provided.
