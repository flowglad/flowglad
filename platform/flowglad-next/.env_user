# LOCAL_USER determines which Flowglad developer's environment variables to use
# This affects which prefixed variables get stripped (e.g., BROOKS_DEV_EMAIL_REDIRECT -> DEV_EMAIL_REDIRECT)
# To change it, update this value to your name (e.g., LOCAL_USER=BROOKS)

# Note: This file is for Flowglad core developers only
# External contributors should copy .env.example to .env.local and configure
# their own environment variables instead of using this user-based system

LOCAL_USER=BROOKS
