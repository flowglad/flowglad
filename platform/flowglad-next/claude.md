## On Every Change
Whenever you complete a task, confirm that everything lints as expected:
```bash
pnpm lint
```

## When Writing TRPC Code
1. Always specify mutation and query outputs using `.output()`
2. If possible, do not write raw ORM code in the procedures. It's pure tech debt. Instead, use db/tableMethods/fooMethods.ts where you can.
3. If you can't, parse the outputs using the appropriate zod schema.
4. Speaking of zod schema, always bias towards using the zod schema found in db/schema

## Write Tests Coverage for Changes to Backend Business Logic

After you are at a good place with your changes, begin writing tests. 

Do this in four steps:
1. Plan test cases — see [@new-test-1-outline-test-cases.md](llm-prompts/new-test-1-outline-test-cases.md)
2. Stub tests — see [@new-test-2-planning-stubs.md](llm-prompts/new-test-2-planning-stubs.md)
3. Prepare global setup — see [@new-test-3-before-each-setup.md](llm-prompts/new-test-3-before-each-setup.md)
4. Implement tests — see [@new-test-4-implementation.md](llm-prompts/new-test-4-implementation.md)
