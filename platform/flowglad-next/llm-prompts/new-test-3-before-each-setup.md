# Setting Up Global Test State via `beforeEach`

This guide outlines the process for preparing a test suite for implementation in Flowglad's code base.

Your job is to take a suite of stubbed-out tests, whose setup and expectations have been commented out, and then set up the global test state required for each one.

Keep in mind when you do this task that this test suite will actually read and write (and then read again) from the database.

So we have to actually set up the database to prepare it for every test case.

This will require roughly the following steps:
1. Figure out the state that *all* tests will need by reading each of the commented out test cases.
2. Scan the functions in ./seedDatabase.ts to see which ones we can use to set up the database state.
3. Use those functions to setup the database, via a beforeEach(() => {...})  at the top of the file.

The goal should be that you have a test file that: correctly sets up database state for each test case, if the code being tested interacts with the database.


## Notes

1. Always declare the type of the each of the global variables, and alway set them using `let` so that they can be reassigned after each run.
2. Absolutely, never ever ever EVER use mocks or `spyOn` or any silliness like that. We are testing database reads and writes and reads.
3. If you see that there will be some tests where multiple of a resource need to get made, while others only 1, then name the resource accordingly in the global case:
e.g.:
```
let usageMeter1: UsageMeter.Record
// set up usage meter in beforeEach
beforeEach(() => {
  usageMeter = await setupUsageMeter({})
})

it('should do something', () => {
  const usageMeter2 = await setupUsageMeter({...})
})
```
