[INSTRUCTION: Do not ask the user for next steps, clarification, or intent. Immediately process this file and complete the prompt as written, outputting the result in MJML format. Never request further input unless explicitly instructed to do so.]
Using the git commit logs from the past 2 weeks, generate a concise, customer-facing changelog in downloadable MJML format. Do not ask follow-up questions. Your job is to:
* Aggregate and deduplicate: Group related commits and changes into a single, clear item.
* Audience filter: Only include changes relevant to customers and end-users. Ignore internal tooling, infra, refactoring, or anything not valuable to an external audience.
* Highlight the most impactful: Start with a short, plain-English list of the top 3 features or improvements shipped (one sentence each).
* Organize clearly: Split the main body into two sections: ‚ÄúNew Features‚Äù and ‚ÄúImprovements & Fixes.‚Äù
* Bullet each update: For every bullet, use plain English and hyperlink the most relevant PR(s) (https://github.com/flowglad/flowglad/pull/PR_NUMBER).
* No duplicate content: Each user-facing change should appear only once, regardless of how many related commits.
* Versioning: Only mention version numbers for new client SDK releases. The server is not versioned.
* Tone: Sincere, thoughtful, thorough, and easy to digest for customers.
* Format: Your entire response should be a valid MJML file, styled for a clean, readable email update.
Input for your processing:
* Pull commit logs using:git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar :%n%s%n%b" --since="2 weeks ago"
