# Extract Billing Context Guide

**Purpose:** This guide provides systematic instructions for extracting and recreating the pricing & billing configurations of any company. The higher quality input and context you gather, the more accurate your pricing model template will be.

---

## üìã Quick Reference Checklist

Before you begin, gather these materials:

- [ ] Company's public pricing page URL
- [ ] Pricing documentation/help center articles
- [ ] Stripe billing portal screenshots (if available)
- [ ] Sample invoices (multiple months preferred)
- [ ] Terms of service / pricing terms
- [ ] FAQ about billing/pricing
- [ ] User testimonials mentioning pricing details

---

## üéØ Step 1: Gather High-Quality Inputs

### **A. Public Pricing Page**
**Where to find:** `company.com/pricing`

**What to extract:**
1. **Plan tiers**: Names, prices, billing intervals (monthly/yearly)
2. **Features per tier**: What's included in each plan
3. **Usage limits**: Request counts, storage limits, user seats, etc.
4. **Trial periods**: Free trial duration and what's included
5. **Add-ons**: Optional purchases beyond base plans
6. **Volume discounts**: Pricing changes at different usage levels

**Questions to answer:**
- Is there a free tier? What does it include?
- Which plans offer annual billing?
- Are there any "Contact Sales" or custom pricing tiers?
- What's the default/recommended plan?

**Example (Cursor):**
```
‚úÖ Hobby: $0/mo
‚úÖ Pro: $20/mo or $240/yr (14-day trial)
‚úÖ Pro+: $60/mo (no annual option)
‚úÖ Ultra: $200/mo (no annual option)
‚úÖ Teams: $40/user/mo
‚úÖ Enterprise: Custom pricing
```

---

### **B. Pricing Documentation**
**Where to find:** `docs.company.com`, `help.company.com`, `company.com/docs/pricing`

**What to extract:**
1. **Usage meters**: How usage is tracked and measured
2. **Rate limits**: Hard caps vs. soft limits
3. **Overage policies**: What happens when limits are exceeded
4. **Billing frequency**: When charges occur (monthly, real-time, etc.)
5. **Credit systems**: Do credits roll over? Do they expire?
6. **Proration rules**: How upgrades/downgrades are handled

**Critical questions:**
- How is usage measured? (requests, tokens, GB, hours, seats)
- What happens when users exceed limits?
  - Hard block?
  - Automatic overage charges?
  - Require plan upgrade?
- Are there different types of usage? (fast vs slow, premium vs standard)
- How often is usage billed? (real-time, daily, monthly)

**Example (Cursor findings):**
```
‚úÖ Usage tracking: Token-based (input, output, cache write, cache read)
‚úÖ Fast vs Slow models: Different limits
‚úÖ Overages: Billed at cost (real-time invoicing)
‚úÖ Credits: Renew monthly, don't roll over
‚úÖ Rate limits: 500 fast requests (Pro), 1,500 (Pro+), 10,000 (Ultra)
```

---

### **C. Stripe Billing Portal Screenshots**
**Where to find:** Customer's Stripe billing portal (`billing.stripe.com`)

**What to capture:**
1. **Subscription list**: Active subscriptions with prices
2. **Invoice history**: Multiple months for pattern analysis
3. **Payment methods**: How customers pay
4. **Billing information**: Name, address, email

**Critical insights:**
- Do subscriptions and usage charges appear on separate invoices?
- How frequently are invoices generated?
- Are there multiple line items per invoice?
- What date patterns exist? (e.g., subscription on 23rd, usage throughout month)

**Example screenshots to request:**
```
üì∏ Screenshot 1: Current subscription details
   ‚Üí Shows: "Cursor Pro Plus - $60.00 per month"

üì∏ Screenshot 2: Invoice history list
   ‚Üí Shows: Multiple invoices with dates and amounts

üì∏ Screenshot 3: Sample invoice expanded
   ‚Üí Shows: Detailed line items, quantities, descriptions
```

---

### **D. Sample Invoices (CRITICAL)**
**Where to find:** Stripe invoices, email receipts, billing portal

**What to analyze:**
1. **Invoice structure**: What line items appear?
2. **Pricing breakdown**: How are charges calculated?
3. **Usage details**: Granular usage metrics shown
4. **Billing patterns**: Timing of charges

**Request multiple invoices:**
- ‚úÖ At least 3 months of history
- ‚úÖ Include both subscription and usage invoices (if separate)
- ‚úÖ Different billing periods (to see renewal patterns)
- ‚úÖ Months with varying usage (low and high)

**What to extract from each invoice:**

```markdown
### Invoice #1: [Date]
**Total:** $X.XX
**Line Items:**
1. Item name: [description]
   - Quantity: X
   - Unit price: $X.XX
   - Subtotal: $X.XX
   - Metadata: [any additional details shown]
   
2. [Repeat for each line item]

**Key observations:**
- Is this a subscription charge or usage charge?
- What period does it cover?
- Any proration shown?
```

**Example (Cursor analysis):**
```
Invoice #UNKQYWBC-0006 (Sep 23, 2025):
‚îú‚îÄ Cursor Pro Plus: $60.00
‚îî‚îÄ Period: Sep 23 - Oct 23, 2025
‚Üí This is the monthly subscription charge

Invoice #UNKQYWBC-0007 (Oct 7, 2025):
‚îú‚îÄ 200 calls to non-max-claude-4-sonnet: $5.96
‚îú‚îÄ 1,120 calls to non-max-claude-4.5-sonnet: $49.27
‚îú‚îÄ 404 calls to claude-4.5-sonnet: $44.83
‚îî‚îÄ Total: $100.06
‚Üí This is pure usage billing (token consumption)

KEY FINDING: Separate billing streams!
- Subscription: Fixed, billed monthly on renewal date
- Usage: Variable, billed as usage occurs (real-time)
```

---

## üîç Step 2: Reverse Engineer the Billing Model

### **Identify the Pricing Model Type**

Based on your research, categorize the model:

#### **Type A: Usage-Limit Subscription** (like Cursor)
- Base subscription unlocks access
- Includes monthly usage credits
- Overages billed separately
- Example: Cursor, Anthropic, OpenAI

#### **Type B: Unlimited Usage Subscription** (like ChatGPT)
- Flat subscription fee
- Unlimited usage for paid tiers
- No metered billing
- Example: ChatGPT, Netflix, Spotify

#### **Type C: Pure Pay-as-You-Go** (like AWS)
- No subscription required
- Pay only for consumption
- Example: AWS, Cloudflare, Twilio

#### **Type D: Seat-Based Subscription** (like GitHub)
- Per-user pricing
- Features scale with plan tier
- Example: GitHub, Slack, Notion

#### **Type E: Freemium with Add-ons** (like Slack)
- Free tier + optional paid features
- One-time or recurring add-ons
- Example: Slack, Dropbox

#### **Type F: Hybrid Subscription + Usage** (like Stripe)
- Base subscription + metered usage
- Both charges on same invoice
- Example: Stripe, Twilio

#### **Type G: Credits Pack** (like OpenAI API)
- Purchase credit bundles
- Credits don't expire
- Example: OpenAI API, AWS credits

---

## üìä Step 3: Map to Template Structure

### **A. Define Usage Meters**

List all dimensions along which usage is tracked:

```typescript
usageMeters: [
  { slug: 'dimension-1', name: 'Display Name' },
  { slug: 'dimension-2', name: 'Display Name' },
]
```

**Common examples:**
- API calls/requests
- Tokens (input, output, cache)
- Storage (GB, TB)
- Bandwidth (GB transferred)
- Compute hours
- Active users/seats
- Messages sent
- Documents processed

**Cursor example:**
```typescript
usageMeters: [
  { slug: 'fast-premium-requests', name: 'Fast Premium Requests' },
]
```

**Note:** Don't over-complicate. If they track tokens but bill by request, use requests as the meter.

---

### **B. Define Features**

Features represent what customers get. Two types:

#### **Toggle Features** (Boolean access)
Use when the feature is on/off:
```typescript
{
  type: FeatureType.Toggle,
  slug: 'background-agents',
  name: 'Background Agents',
  description: 'Background agents for proactive suggestions',
  active: true,
}
```

#### **Usage Credit Grant Features** (Metered allowances)
Use when the feature grants a specific amount of usage:
```typescript
{
  type: FeatureType.UsageCreditGrant,
  slug: 'pro-fast-requests',
  name: '500 Fast Premium Requests',
  description: '500 fast premium requests included per month',
  usageMeterSlug: 'fast-premium-requests',
  amount: 500,
  renewalFrequency: FeatureUsageGrantFrequency.EveryBillingPeriod,
  active: true,
}
```

**Naming convention:**
- Start with the amount: `"500 Fast Premium Requests"` NOT `"Fast Requests - Pro"`
- Be specific about what it grants
- Include renewal info in description

---

### **C. Define Products**

Each product = something a customer can purchase.

#### **Subscription Products**
```typescript
{
  product: {
    name: 'Pro',
    default: false,  // Only ONE product can be default (the free tier)
    description: '$20/mo + 500 fast requests included (overages at cost)',
    slug: 'pro',
    active: true,
    imageURL: null,
    displayFeatures: null,
    singularQuantityLabel: null,  // null for subscriptions
    pluralQuantityLabel: null,
  },
  prices: [
    {
      type: PriceType.Subscription,
      slug: 'pro-monthly',
      isDefault: true,
      name: 'Pro Plan (Monthly)',
      usageMeterId: null,  // null for subscription prices
      trialPeriodDays: 14,  // null if no trial
      usageEventsPerUnit: null,
      active: true,
      intervalUnit: IntervalUnit.Month,
      intervalCount: 1,
      unitPrice: 2000,  // Amount in cents ($20.00)
    },
  ],
  features: ['pro-fast-requests', 'unlimited-completions', 'background-agents'],
}
```

#### **Usage Products** (for overages/pay-as-you-go)
```typescript
{
  product: {
    name: 'Fast Request Overages',
    default: false,
    description: 'Additional fast requests billed at cost after included credits exhausted',
    slug: 'fast-request-overages',
    active: true,
    imageURL: null,
    displayFeatures: null,
    singularQuantityLabel: 'request',  // ‚Üê IMPORTANT for usage products
    pluralQuantityLabel: 'requests',
  },
  prices: [
    {
      type: PriceType.Usage,
      slug: 'fast-request-overage',
      isDefault: true,
      name: 'Fast Request Overage',
      usageMeterSlug: 'fast-premium-requests',  // ‚Üê Links to usage meter
      trialPeriodDays: null,
      usageEventsPerUnit: 1,  // How many events = 1 billable unit
      active: true,
      intervalUnit: IntervalUnit.Month,
      intervalCount: 1,
      unitPrice: 10,  // $0.10 per request
    },
  ],
  features: [],  // Usually empty for pure usage products
}
```

## üî¨ Step 4: Validate Your Work

### **Invoice Reconciliation**
Match your template structure to real invoices:

1. **Create a test invoice manually** based on your template
2. **Compare to real invoice** from the company
3. **Check each line item**:
   - Does the charge amount match?
   - Is the description similar?
   - Are quantities calculated correctly?
   - Do dates align with billing periods?

### **Common Discrepancies to Check:**

#### ‚ùå **Problem:** Subscription charges not showing up
**Cause:** Forgot to create subscription product  
**Fix:** Add base subscription product for each tier

#### ‚ùå **Problem:** Usage charges billed incorrectly
**Cause:** Wrong `usageEventsPerUnit` value  
**Fix:** Check if 1 event = 1 unit, or if they batch (e.g., per 1000 tokens)

#### ‚ùå **Problem:** Features not showing in preview
**Cause:** Feature slugs don't match in product's `features` array  
**Fix:** Verify feature slug references are correct

#### ‚ùå **Problem:** Usage meters not appearing in dropdowns
**Cause:** `usageMeterSlug` doesn't match actual meter slug  
**Fix:** Double-check slug spelling and case

#### ‚ùå **Problem:** Default product has trial period
**Cause:** Free plans can't have trials (backend validation error)  
**Fix:** Set `trialPeriodDays: null` on default products

---

## üß™ Step 5: Test Edge Cases

### **Scenario Testing:**

1. **Free tier user** (month 1)
   - What do they get?
   - Any trial credits?
   - Expected charges: $0

2. **Upgrading user** (mid-month)
   - Proration rules?
   - Credits transferred?
   - Expected charges: Prorated amount + usage

3. **Power user** (exceeds limits)
   - What happens at limit?
   - Overage charges applied?
   - Expected charges: Base + overage

4. **Downgrading user**
   - Credits lost?
   - Immediate or end of period?
   - Expected charges: Depends on timing

5. **Annual subscriber**
   - Upfront or monthly billing?
   - Usage still billed separately?
   - Expected charges: Annual fee + usage (if applicable)

## üéì Real Example: Cursor Analysis

### **What We Gathered:**

1. **Pricing Page** ‚Üí Basic tier structure ($0, $20, $60, $200)
2. **Documentation** ‚Üí Revealed "500 fast requests" limits, but unclear if included or total
3. **Stripe Portal Screenshot** ‚Üí Showed "Cursor Pro Plus" subscription
4. **Invoice #1** (Sep 23) ‚Üí $60.00 for "Cursor Pro Plus" (subscription)
5. **Invoice #2** (Oct 7) ‚Üí $100.06 for token usage (separate from subscription!)

### **Critical Discoveries:**

#### **Discovery #1: Two Billing Streams**
Initial assumption: $20/mo includes $20 of usage  
Reality: $20/mo is access fee, usage billed separately

**Evidence:**
```
Sep 23: $60.00 ‚Üí Cursor Pro Plus (subscription)
Oct 7:  $100.06 ‚Üí Usage (200 + 1,120 + 404 token calls)
```

#### **Discovery #2: Token-Based, Not Request-Based**
Initial assumption: "500 fast requests" = 500 API calls  
Reality: Tracked by tokens (input/output/cache), billed at API cost

**Evidence:**
```
Invoice line item:
"200 token-based usage calls to non-max-claude-4-sonnet-thinking,
totalling: $5.96. Input tokens: 735,195, Output tokens: 72,511,
Cache write tokens: 472,458, Cache read tokens: 5,158,109"
```

#### **Discovery #3: Real-Time Usage Billing**
Initial assumption: Usage billed at month-end  
Reality: Multiple usage invoices generated throughout the month

**Evidence:**
```
Sep 3:  $20.02 (usage)
Sep 5:  $40.02 (usage)
Sep 10: $60.01 (usage)
Sep 17: $80.47 (usage)
```

### **Final Template Structure:**

```typescript
// 4 subscription products (access tiers)
- Hobby: $0/mo, 0 included requests
- Pro: $20/mo, 500 included requests  
- Pro+: $60/mo, 1,500 included requests (3x)
- Ultra: $200/mo, 10,000 included requests (20x)

// 1 usage product (overages)
- Fast Request Overages: $0.10/request (usage-based)

// Usage meter
- fast-premium-requests

// Features combine:
- Usage credit grants (monthly allowances)
- Toggle features (unlimited slow, completions, etc.)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### **1. Don't Trust Marketing Copy Alone**
Pricing pages often simplify. The invoices reveal the truth.

**Example:**
- Marketing: "500 fast requests included"
- Reality: Could mean 500 included OR 500 rate limit before throttling
- Invoices confirm: 500 included, then billed per-token

### **2. Look for Dual Billing Patterns**
Many SaaS products charge:
- Subscription for access (fixed)
- Usage for consumption (variable)

If you see two invoice types, you likely need both subscription + usage products.

### **3. Check Granularity Carefully**
Companies may track at fine granularity (tokens) but market at coarse granularity (requests).

**Simplification strategy:**
- Template: Use simpler metric (requests)
- Description: Note underlying complexity (token-based)
- Allows users to customize further if needed

### **4. Verify Trial Periods**
- Free tiers can't have trials (backend validation)
- Only paid plans should have `trialPeriodDays` set
- Hobby plan with "includes 14-day Pro trial" ‚â† trial on Hobby itself

### **5. Annual Pricing Patterns**
Check if annual pricing exists for ALL tiers or only some.

**Cursor example:**
- Pro: Has annual ($240/yr)
- Pro+: Monthly only
- Ultra: Monthly only

Don't assume all tiers have annual options!

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### **Pitfall #1: Confusing Access with Usage**
```
‚ùå Wrong: "Pro plan includes $20 of usage"
‚úÖ Right: "Pro plan: $20/mo subscription + 500 requests (overages at cost)"
```

### **Pitfall #2: Missing Overage Products**
```
‚ùå Wrong: Only model subscription tiers
‚úÖ Right: Add usage product for overage billing
```

### **Pitfall #3: Incorrect Price Types**
```
‚ùå Wrong: Using Subscription type for pay-per-use
‚úÖ Right: 
   - Subscription = recurring charge (monthly/yearly)
   - Usage = metered charge (per unit consumed)
   - SinglePayment = one-time purchase
```

### **Pitfall #4: Wrong Quantity Labels**
```
‚ùå Wrong: Usage product with no singularQuantityLabel
Result: Shows "$0.10/mo" instead of "$0.10/request"

‚úÖ Right: Set singularQuantityLabel: 'request'
Result: Shows "$0.10/request"
```

### **Pitfall #5: Hardcoding Feature Amounts in Names**
```
‚ùå Wrong for old templates: "API Requests - Pro" (loses amount)
‚úÖ Right for new templates: "500 API Requests" (clear amount)
```
