We are trying to add payments and billing to our product. 

In order to generate a comprehensive guide, we need a breakdown of how this application's code works. Most notably, we need to know:

1. Where in the directory does the application server live? If we want to mount an API route, where would we mount it? For all file locations, give the relative path.

2. What language is the server written in?

3. Does it use any framework, such as Next.js or Express for Typescript or Flask or Django for Python?

4. How are requests to the server authenticated? Can you include specific code samples that show how users are identified?

5. Are the customers for this product the individual users (most commonly B2C, or "consumer") or are customers for the product businesses / teams / organizations (e.g. B2B)? If they are businesses, what functions / methods does the server app use to derive the business associated that a given request belongs to?

Give your response in markdown format in a way that is easy to parse, so that an expert can use it to generate a custom integration guide for you.
