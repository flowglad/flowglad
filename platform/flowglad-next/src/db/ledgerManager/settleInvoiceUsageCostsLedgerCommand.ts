/**
 * This command handles the entire accounting process for settling a paid invoice's
 * usage costs. It's designed to be an atomic, idempotent operation that takes a
 * paid invoice and ensures all associated usage debts on the ledger are cleared.
 *
 * The process is as follows:
 * 1. A single parent `LedgerTransaction` is created to bundle all accounting entries for this settlement.
 * 2. For each usage-based line item on the invoice, a `UsageCredit` grant is created. The value of this grant
 *    matches the amount paid for that line item, and the grant is sourced from the paid invoice.
 * 3. A `credit_grant_recognized` ledger entry is created for each new `UsageCredit` grant, officially posting
 *    the credit value to the corresponding ledger account.
 * 4. The command finds all `usage_cost` ledger entries that were part of the invoice's original billing run.
 * 5. It then creates `UsageCreditApplication` records to apply the new settlement credits against each of these outstanding usage costs.
 * 6. Finally, for each `UsageCreditApplication`, it creates a pair of ledger entries:
 *    - A `debit` from the credit balance (`UsageCreditApplicationDebitFromCreditBalance`).
 *    - A `credit` towards the usage cost (`UsageCreditApplicationCreditTowardsUsageCost`).
 * This final step zeroes out the usage debt for the period, completing the settlement.
