# Test Coverage Analysis for PR #3: Subscription Selection Logic Updates

## Current Coverage Assessment

### ✅ Covered Areas (in subscriptionMethods.upgrade.simple.test.ts)

1. **isSubscriptionCurrent function**
   - Returns false for Active status with upgraded_to_paid cancellation reason
   - Returns true for Active status with null cancellation reason
   - Returns true for Active status with customer_request cancellation reason
   - Returns false for Canceled status

2. **selectActiveSubscriptionsForCustomer function**
   - Excludes upgraded subscription and returns only active paid subscription

3. **selectCurrentSubscriptionForCustomer function**
   - Returns the active paid subscription when free is upgraded
   - Returns null when no active subscriptions exist

4. **subscriptionWithCurrent helper**
   - Adds correct current flag based on status and cancellation reason

## ❌ Missing Test Coverage

Based on the PR #3 enhanced gameplan and ast-grep analysis, the following areas need test coverage:

### 1. API Integration Tests

#### A. Customer Billing API (`customersRouter.ts`)
These tests ensure that the `isSubscriptionCurrent` logic correctly propagates through the API layer.

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("customers.getBilling", () => {
  it("should exclude upgraded free subscription from currentSubscriptions array", () => {
    // Setup: Create customer with upgraded free subscription and active paid subscription
    // Call: customers.getBilling
    // Assert: currentSubscriptions only contains paid subscription
  })

  it("should include paid subscription after upgrade in currentSubscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create customer with free->paid upgrade chain
    // Call: customers.getBilling
    // Assert: currentSubscriptions contains only the paid subscription
  })

  it("should handle multiple subscription upgrades in chain correctly", () => {
    // Setup: Create customer with free->basic->premium upgrade chain
    // Call: customers.getBilling
    // Assert: currentSubscriptions contains only the premium subscription
  })
})
```

#### B. Subscriptions Router API (`subscriptionsRouter.ts`)
These tests verify that subscription endpoints correctly use the updated logic.

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("subscriptions.list", () => {
  it("should exclude upgraded subscriptions when filtering for active status", () => {
    // Setup: Create multiple subscriptions with one upgraded
    // Call: subscriptions.list with status filter
    // Assert: Upgraded subscription not in results
  })

  it("should include upgraded subscriptions when specifically filtering for canceled", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded subscription (canceled with upgraded_to_paid reason)
    // Call: subscriptions.list with canceled status filter
    // Assert: Upgraded subscription appears in results
  })

  it("should set current flag correctly for all subscriptions in list", () => {
    // Setup: Mix of active, upgraded, and canceled subscriptions
    // Call: subscriptions.list
    // Assert: current flag is false for upgraded, true for active non-upgraded
  })
})

describe("subscriptions.get", () => {
  it("should return current:false for upgraded subscription", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded subscription
    // Call: subscriptions.get
    // Assert: current flag is false
  })

  it("should return current:true for active non-upgraded subscription", () => {
    // Setup: Create active subscription
    // Call: subscriptions.get
    // Assert: current flag is true
  })
})

describe("subscriptions.adjust", () => {
  it("should not allow adjustment of upgraded subscription", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded subscription
    // Call: subscriptions.adjust
    // Assert: Should handle gracefully (error or skip)
  })
})

describe("subscriptions.cancel", () => {
  it("should handle cancellation of already-upgraded subscription", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded subscription
    // Call: subscriptions.cancel
    // Assert: Should handle gracefully
  })
})

describe("subscriptions.create", () => {
  it("should return correct current flag for newly created subscription", () => {
    // Setup: Create new subscription
    // Call: subscriptions.create
    // Assert: current flag is true for new active subscription
  })
})
```

#### C. Customer Billing Portal Router (`customerBillingPortalRouter.ts`)
**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("customerBillingPortal.getBilling", () => {
  it("should only show current subscription in portal", () => {
    // Setup: Customer with upgraded subscription chain
    // Call: customerBillingPortal.getBilling
    // Assert: Only shows active paid subscription
  })

  it("should handle subscription cancellation in portal correctly", () => {
    // Setup: Customer with active subscription
    // Call: customerBillingPortal.cancelSubscription
    // Assert: Correct current flag updates
  })
})
```

### 2. Billing Period Selection Tests

#### A. selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange (`billingPeriodMethods.ts`)
This function is critical for billing runs to exclude upgraded subscriptions.

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange", () => {
  it("should exclude billing periods for upgraded subscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create billing periods for both upgraded and active subscriptions
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange
    // Assert: Only returns billing periods for non-upgraded subscriptions
  })

  it("should include billing periods for active subscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create billing periods for active subscription
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange
    // Assert: Returns all active subscription billing periods
  })

  it("should respect date range filtering", () => {
    // Setup: Create billing periods across different date ranges
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange with specific dates
    // Assert: Only returns periods within date range
  })

  it("should handle subscriptions canceled for non-upgrade reasons", () => {
    // Setup: Create subscription canceled with customer_request reason
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange
    // Assert: Includes billing periods for non-upgrade cancellations
  })

  it("should filter by organizationId and livemode correctly", () => {
    // Setup: Create billing periods for different orgs and livemodes
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange
    // Assert: Only returns matching org and livemode periods
  })
})
```

### 3. Analytics & Dashboard Tests

#### A. Subscriber Calculation Helpers (`subscriberCalculationHelpers.ts`)
These tests ensure churn metrics correctly exclude upgrades.

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("calculateSubscriberBreakdown", () => {
  it("should not count upgraded subscriptions as churned", () => {
    // Setup: Create subscriptions with one upgraded to paid
    // Call: calculateSubscriberBreakdown
    // Assert: Churned count excludes upgraded subscription
  })

  it("should count customer_request cancellations as churned", () => {
    // Setup: Create subscription canceled with customer_request
    // Call: calculateSubscriberBreakdown
    // Assert: Churned count includes this subscription
  })

  it("should handle mixed cancellation reasons correctly", () => {
    // Setup: Mix of upgraded_to_paid and customer_request cancellations
    // Call: calculateSubscriberBreakdown
    // Assert: Only customer_request counted in churn
  })
})

describe("getActiveSubscriptionsForPeriod", () => {
  it("should exclude upgraded subscriptions from active count", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded and active subscriptions in period
    // Call: getActiveSubscriptionsForPeriod
    // Assert: Upgraded subscriptions not included in results
  })

  it("should correctly filter by date period", () => {
    // Setup: Create subscriptions across different periods
    // Call: getActiveSubscriptionsForPeriod with specific dates
    // Assert: Only returns subscriptions active in that period
  })

  it("should handle subscription lifecycle transitions", () => {
    // Setup: Subscription that starts active then gets upgraded
    // Call: getActiveSubscriptionsForPeriod for different dates
    // Assert: Correctly included/excluded based on upgrade timing
  })
})
```

### 4. Subscription Item Methods Tests

#### A. selectRichSubscriptionsAndActiveItems (`subscriptionItemMethods.ts`)
**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("selectRichSubscriptionsAndActiveItems", () => {
  it("should set current flag correctly for rich subscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create subscriptions with items, some upgraded
    // Call: selectRichSubscriptionsAndActiveItems
    // Assert: current flag false for upgraded, true for active
  })

  it("should process subscription items correctly for upgraded subscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create upgraded subscription with items
    // Call: selectRichSubscriptionsAndActiveItems
    // Assert: Items returned but subscription marked as not current
  })
})
```

### 5. Edge Cases & Complex Scenarios

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("Upgrade Chain Edge Cases", () => {
  it("should handle circular reference protection", () => {
    // Setup: Attempt to create circular reference (A->B->A)
    // Call: selectCurrentSubscriptionForCustomer
    // Assert: Doesn't infinite loop, returns sensible result
  })

  it("should handle broken upgrade chains gracefully", () => {
    // Setup: Create chain with missing replacedBySubscriptionId target
    // Call: selectCurrentSubscriptionForCustomer
    // Assert: Returns last valid subscription in chain
  })

  it("should handle concurrent upgrades correctly", () => {
    // Setup: Simulate race condition with two concurrent upgrade attempts
    // Call: Both upgrade operations
    // Assert: Only one succeeds, data remains consistent
  })

  it("should handle upgrade chain with multiple branches", () => {
    // Setup: Complex scenario with forked upgrade paths
    // Call: selectCurrentSubscriptionForCustomer
    // Assert: Correctly identifies the true current subscription
  })
})
```

### 6. Performance Tests

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe("Performance", () => {
  it("should efficiently query subscriptions for customers with many subscriptions", () => {
    // Setup: Create customer with 100+ subscription history
    // Call: selectCurrentSubscriptionForCustomer
    // Assert: Completes within reasonable time (<100ms)
  })

  it("should efficiently filter billing periods for large date ranges", () => {
    // Setup: Create many billing periods across wide date range
    // Call: selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange
    // Assert: Completes efficiently with proper indexing
  })
})
```

## Test Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange tests
2. API integration tests for customers.getBilling
3. Churn calculation tests in subscriberCalculationHelpers

### Medium Priority (User-Facing Features)
1. subscriptions.list API tests
2. customerBillingPortal tests
3. subscriptions.get/create/adjust/cancel API tests

### Low Priority (Edge Cases & Performance)
1. Circular reference protection
2. Performance tests
3. Complex upgrade chain scenarios

## Notes on Test Implementation

1. **Database Layer Tests**: Focus on the actual behavior and data consistency rather than testing transaction rollbacks.

2. **Integration Tests**: Should test the full flow from API call to database and back, ensuring the `cancellationReason` parameter properly flows through all layers.

3. **Mock vs Real Data**: Use real database transactions in tests to ensure constraints and relationships work correctly.

4. **Test Data Setup**: Create helper functions to set up complex subscription upgrade scenarios consistently across tests.

5. **Assertion Focus**: Always verify both the positive case (what should be included) and negative case (what should be excluded).

## Summary

The existing test file (`subscriptionMethods.upgrade.simple.test.ts`) provides good unit test coverage for the core `subscriptionMethods.ts` functions but lacks:

1. **API Integration Testing**: No tests for how the changes affect API endpoints
2. **Billing Period Selection**: No tests for the new `selectActiveBillingPeriodsForDateRange` function
3. **Analytics/Dashboard**: No tests for churn calculation exclusions
4. **Complex Scenarios**: No tests for edge cases like circular references or broken chains
5. **Performance**: No tests to ensure queries remain performant with large datasets

These additional tests are essential to ensure PR #3's changes work correctly across the entire system, not just at the unit level.
