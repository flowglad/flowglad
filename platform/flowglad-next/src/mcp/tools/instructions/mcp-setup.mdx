# Flowglad MCP Middleware Setup

Here's how you set up flowglad's Middleware for a Next.js-based MCP server in Vercel.

1. If there isn't already a `[transport]/route.ts` directory in the project, create one in. Ideally this is in `/app`. If the directory can be found elsewhere in the codebase

2. Use the `mcpHandlerWithFlowglad` to create the MCP function. And the `toolWithFeatureAccessCheck` to create the access check.

Here are the parameters you need to get right:
1. successURL and cancelURL - make stubs of these in the project if they're not already there.
2. upgradePriceSlug: this should be the price that the customer will be prompted to purchase via a checkout session if they are unauthorized.
3. The feature slug - this should be what we use to determine authorization.
4. A method to derive the implied flowglad customer from a given incoming http request. Ideally this should get us as much information of the following shape as possible: 
{
  externalId: 'the_applications_concept_of_customer',
  name: 'The Customer's Name',
  email: 'admin@thecustomer.com'
}

```ts
import { mcpUserFromRequest } from '@/utils/auth-helpers/server';
import {
  FlowgladServer,
  mcpHandlerWithFlowglad,
  toolWithFeatureAccessCheck
} from '@flowglad/nextjs/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const handler = mcpHandlerWithFlowglad(
  async (server, flowglad) => {
    server.tool(
      'echo',
      'description',
      {
        message: z.string()
      },
      toolWithFeatureAccessCheck(
        async ({ message }) => ({
          content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Tool echo: ${message}` }]
        }),
        {
          featureSlug: 'echo',
          flowgladServer: flowglad,
          upgradePriceSlug: 'pro_plan',
          successUrl: 'http://localhost:3001/purchase/post-payment',
          cancelUrl: 'http://localhost:3001/purchase/post-payment'
        }
      )
    );
  },
  async (request) => {
    const user = await mcpUserFromRequest(request);
    return new FlowgladServer({
      baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
      getRequestingCustomer: () => Promise.resolve(user)
    });
  }
);

export { handler as GET, handler as POST, handler as DELETE };
```
