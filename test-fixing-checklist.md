# Test Fixing Implementation Checklist

## 1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Pull/checkout the BrooksFlannery-maputo branch from main
- [ ] Navigate to flowglad-next directory
- [ ] Read package.json to understand available commands
- [ ] Initialize the environment with `init_claude_code_flowglad_next`

## 2. Generate Change Analysis
- [ ] Run diff between current branch and main
- [ ] Create `branch-changes.md` file with table containing:
  - Column 1: Category of change (e.g., feature, refactor, config, etc.)
  - Column 2: Path and line number for change
  - Column 3: Plain text explanation of what changed
- [ ] Ensure all changes are captured in detail

## 3. Run Test Suite and Document Failures
- [ ] Execute the full test suite
- [ ] Create `failing-tests.md` file with table containing:
  - Column 1: Category of what the test is testing for
  - Column 2: Line numbers and path for where the test is located
  - Column 3: Line numbers and path for what is being tested
  - Column 4: Plain text explanation of why the test failed
  - Column 5: Whether the failure was due to code issues or outdated tests

## 4. Create Test Fix Checklist
- [ ] Create `test-fix-checklist.md` with organized test fixes
- [ ] Exclude tests that failed due to timeout
- [ ] Prioritize tests in this order:
  1. Tests that failed due to being outdated
  2. Tests that failed due to code issues
- [ ] Group test failures by category
- [ ] Create guides for each category of bug fix within the checklist

## 5. Fix Tests by Category
- [ ] For each category of tests:
  - [ ] Follow the guide created for that category
  - [ ] Fix all tests in the category
  - [ ] Run only the tests that were changed (if possible)
  - [ ] Verify fixes are working
  - [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] After all categories are fixed, run full test suite once more to verify

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update all MD files with final results
- [ ] Document any remaining issues or concerns
- [ ] Create summary of all changes made
