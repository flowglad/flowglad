name: Publish Packages and Create Release

# This workflow publishes packages to npm and creates a GitHub release after the
# version PR (created by version-pr.yml) is merged to main.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Version PR from version-pr.yml is merged to main
# 2. This workflow detects the merged PR (by title or label)
# 3. Publishes all packages to npm using `bun run packages:publish`
# 4. Extracts version and changelog from the updated packages
# 5. Creates a GitHub release with tag v<version> and changelog content
