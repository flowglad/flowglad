Description

it seems that customers from fractal are not having pricing models assigned to them on creation

This may be an issue just with old customers or with fractal not having a pricing model. needs some investigation

To verify this is not an issue let's do the following: add test coverage to paymentIntentSucceeded test cases (in processPaymentIntentStatusUpdated.test.ts)

The test coverage should verify that when a checkout session is created that does not have a customer ID attached to it and it's attached to a payment intent, that that payment intent when it succeeds, if it has a checkout session ID in its metadata and that checkout session ID doesn't have a customer ID that when they create the customer as a result of that payment intent success, the customer should have a pricing model attached to it that is the default pricing model for that organization.

The issue seems to be that process purchase bookkeeping for checkout session does not use create customer bookkeeping and as a result since it uses insert customer there seems to be some exposure to the fact that the customer is not getting a pricing model attached so ideally if it's possible we would actually replace that call to insert customer in process purchase bookkeeping for checkout session we would replace that insert customer call with create customer bookkeeping and that would handle all of the side effects necessary including if I'm not mistaken including creating a striped customer and associating that stripe customer ID it'll handle all of those side effects so that should solve that problem

The fix seems to be to use createCustomerBookkeeping in processPurchaseBookkeepingForCheckoutSession instead of insertCustomer, so that we get all the side effects.

It turns out those side effects aren't just pricing model association, but also that we get eventsToInsert - so as part of these changes we need to also make the following adjustments in all of the codepaths that consume processPurchaseBookkeeping to make them use comprehensiveAdmin/AuthenticatedTransaction. This includes:

all tests of processPurchaseBookkeeping
all files that consume processPurchaseBookkeeping
We also need to make these changes:

add test coverage to processPurchaseBookkeeping / processPaymentIntentStatusUpdated to verify that events are created for customer creation when customer creation succeeds


# Our incorrect attempt at satisfying the above comment

## Overview
This commit introduces support for anonymous customer creation during checkout sessions, allowing customers to be created without requiring authentication. The changes refactor the customer creation logic to support both authenticated and anonymous scenarios.

## Key Changes

### 1. Bookkeeping Refactor (`src/utils/bookkeeping.ts`)

#### New Function: `createAnonymousCustomerBookkeeping`
- **Purpose**: Core function for creating customers that can handle both authenticated and anonymous scenarios
- **Key Features**:
  - Accepts optional `userId` parameter (can be null for anonymous customers)
  - Removes organizationId validation for anonymous customers
  - Requires a default pricing model for anonymous customer creation
  - Throws error if no pricing model is available for anonymous customers

#### Refactored Function: `createCustomerBookkeeping`
- **Purpose**: Thin wrapper for authenticated customer creation
- **Changes**:
  - Now delegates to `createAnonymousCustomerBookkeeping`
  - Maintains existing security validation for authenticated users
  - Passes through the authenticated `userId`

### 2. Checkout Session Processing (`src/utils/bookkeeping/checkoutSessions.ts`)

#### Enhanced Anonymous Customer Creation
- **Before**: Used simple `insertCustomer` for anonymous customers
- **After**: Uses `createAnonymousCustomerBookkeeping` for proper bookkeeping
- **Benefits**:
  - Creates associated subscription and subscription items
  - Generates proper events for audit trail
  - Ensures pricing model consistency

#### New Event Tracking
- Added `eventsToInsert` array to track events generated during customer creation
- Events are now properly propagated through the checkout process

### 3. Test Updates (`src/utils/bookkeeping.test.ts`)

#### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Added**: `setupUserAndCustomer` import and usage
- **Changed**: Replaced hardcoded `'user_test'` with actual test user IDs
- **Benefit**: More realistic test scenarios that match production behavior

### 4. Supporting Files Updates

#### `processNonPaymentCheckoutSession.ts`
- Added `eventsToInsert` to return value
- Ensures events are properly tracked for non-payment flows

#### `processSetupIntent.ts`
- Added `eventsToInsert` parameter passing
- Maintains event tracking consistency across all checkout flows

## Technical Benefits

### 1. **Improved Data Consistency**
- Anonymous customers now get proper pricing model assignments
- Subscription and subscription items are created automatically
- Events are tracked for audit purposes

### 2. **Enhanced Security**
- Anonymous customers can only be created with valid pricing models
- Organization validation is maintained for authenticated users
- Clear separation between authenticated and anonymous flows

### 3. **Better Test Coverage**
- Tests now use realistic user data instead of hardcoded values
- More accurate representation of production scenarios

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- All customer creation events are now properly tracked
- Better visibility into customer lifecycle events

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/bookkeeping.ts` - Core refactoring
- `src/utils/bookkeeping.test.ts` - Test improvements
- `src/utils/bookkeeping/checkoutSessions.ts` - Anonymous customer creation
- `src/utils/bookkeeping/processNonPaymentCheckoutSession.ts` - Event tracking
- `src/utils/bookkeeping/processSetupIntent.ts` - Event tracking

## Impact
This refactor enables anonymous checkout flows while maintaining security and data consistency. The changes are backward compatible and improve the overall robustness of the customer creation process.

## Result
I reverted these changes after my cto gave me this advice:

Omit<..., 'userId'> 

on line 342 of Bookkeeping.ts

export const createCustomerBookkeeping = async (
  payload: {
    customer: Omit<Customer.Insert, 'livemode'>
  },
  {
    transaction,
    organizationId,
    livemode,
  }: AuthenticatedTransactionParams    <--- here
): Promise<

## TypeScript Implementation Options

### Option 1: Make userId Optional (Simplest)
```typescript
export const createCustomerBookkeeping = async (
  payload: {
    customer: Omit<Customer.Insert, 'livemode'>
  },
  {
    transaction,
    organizationId,
    livemode,
    userId, // Make this optional
  }: Omit<AuthenticatedTransactionParams, 'userId'> & { userId?: string } // Clean TypeScript approach
): Promise<...> => {
  // Handle both cases inside the function
  if (userId) {
    // Authenticated flow - existing logic
  } else {
    // Anonymous flow - skip userId validation, ensure pricing model exists
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Discriminated Union (Cleanest TypeScript)
```typescript
type CustomerCreationParams = 
  | { type: 'authenticated'; userId: string; organizationId: string; transaction: DbTransaction; livemode: boolean }
  | { type: 'anonymous'; organizationId: string; transaction: DbTransaction; livemode: boolean }

export const createCustomerBookkeeping = async (
  payload: {
    customer: Omit<Customer.Insert, 'livemode'>
  },
  params: CustomerCreationParams
): Promise<...> => {
  if (params.type === 'authenticated') {
    // Use params.userId, validate organizationId match
  } else {
    // Anonymous flow, ensure pricing model exists
  }
}
```

## üö® CRITICAL EVENT PROCESSING FIX (Session 2)

**Problem Discovered**: During testing, we discovered that while `CustomerCreated` and `SubscriptionCreated` events were being created by `createCustomerBookkeeping`, they were **not being processed and stored in the database** during anonymous customer creation.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- The `processPurchaseBookkeepingForCheckoutSession` function was storing `eventsToInsert` from `createCustomerBookkeeping` but not processing them immediately
- Events were being lost in the call chain, causing incomplete audit trails
- This was a critical bug that would have broken event-driven systems and analytics

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// In checkoutSessions.ts - Added immediate event processing
if (customerBookkeepingResult.eventsToInsert && customerBookkeepingResult.eventsToInsert.length > 0) {
  await bulkInsertOrDoNothingEventsByHash(
    customerBookkeepingResult.eventsToInsert,
    transaction
  )
}
```

**Test Enhancements**:
- Fixed test setup to properly simulate anonymous customer creation (`customerId: null`)
- Added comprehensive event verification in tests
- Verified both `CustomerCreated` and `SubscriptionCreated` events are properly stored
- Fixed event assertion logic to check correct payload structure

**Impact**: This fix ensures the complete event processing pipeline works end-to-end, making the anonymous customer creation system fully functional with proper audit trails.
