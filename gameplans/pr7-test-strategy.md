# PR 7: Customer Subscription Notification Test Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the customer subscription email notification feature. Tests are organized by component and scenario to ensure complete coverage of all notification paths.

## 1. Email Template Tests

### CustomerSubscriptionCreatedEmail Component

   - Expectations: Shows "$10.00/month" in price display

3. **Formats yearly subscription correctly**
   - Setup: Pass interval='year', price=12000
   - Expectations: Shows "$120.00/year" in price display

4. **Handles missing payment method gracefully**
   - Setup: Pass paymentMethodLast4 as undefined
   - Expectations: Shows generic payment text without last 4 digits

5. **Includes organization branding when logo provided**
   - Setup: Pass organizationLogoUrl with valid URL
   - Expectations: Logo img tag present in header

6. **Generates correct billing portal URL**
   - Setup: Pass valid organizationId and customerExternalId
   - Expectations: Button href contains correct portal URL structure

7. **Displays next billing date in readable format**
   - Setup: Pass nextBillingDate as Date object
   - Expectations: Date formatted as human-readable string (e.g., "Jan 15, 2025")

### CustomerSubscriptionUpgradedEmail Component
**File**: `src/email-templates/__tests__/customer-subscription-upgraded.test.tsx`

   - Setup: Pass nextBillingDate for immediate charge
   - Expectations: Shows "First charge: [date]" instead of "Next billing date"

4. **Includes upgrade confirmation in subject/header**
   - Setup: Standard props
   - Expectations: Header shows "Subscription upgraded" clearly

5. **All other standard cases from Created template**
   - Currency formatting, payment method, portal URL, etc.

## 2. Trigger.dev Task Tests

### sendCustomerSubscriptionCreatedNotificationTask
**File**: `src/trigger/notifications/__tests__/send-customer-subscription-created-notification.test.ts`

#### Test Cases:

1. **Successfully sends email for new paid subscription**
   - Setup: Mock valid customer, subscription, price (unitPrice > 0), organization

   - Expectations: Email sent with undefined paymentMethodLast4

4. **Uses default payment method when available**
   - Setup: Multiple payment methods, one marked as default
   - Expectations: Uses the default payment method's last4

5. **Falls back to first payment method when no default**
   - Setup: Multiple payment methods, none marked as default
   - Expectations: Uses first payment method's last4

6. **Extracts last4 from paymentMethodData JSON**
   - Setup: Payment method with paymentMethodData.last4 = "4242"
   - Expectations: Email receives "4242" as paymentMethodLast4

7. **Calculates monthly billing date correctly**
   - Setup: Subscription created Jan 15, price.intervalUnit = 'month'
   - Expectations: nextBillingDate = Feb 15

8. **Calculates yearly billing date correctly**

   - Customer email, payment method, billing calculations, etc.

### Idempotency Wrapper Tests

1. **Prevents duplicate emails for same subscription**
   - Setup: Call idempotent wrapper twice with same subscriptionId
   - Expectations: Only one trigger.dev task triggered

2. **Generates unique keys for different subscriptions**
   - Setup: Call with different subscriptionIds
   - Expectations: Both tasks trigger successfully

## 3. Workflow Integration Tests

### createSubscriptionWorkflow Integration
**File**: `src/subscriptions/createSubscription/__tests__/workflow.test.ts`

#### Test Cases:

1. **Sends customer notification for new paid subscription**
   - Setup: Create subscription with unitPrice > 0, no upgrade metadata
   - Expectations: idempotentSendCustomerSubscriptionCreatedNotification called

2. **Sends upgrade notification when metadata present**
   - Setup: Create subscription with upgraded_from_subscription_id in metadata
   - Expectations: idempotentSendCustomerSubscriptionUpgradedNotification called

3. **Does NOT send notification for free subscription**

     - Payment method last 4 matches

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Resilience Tests

1. **Handles Resend API failures gracefully**
   - Setup: Mock Resend to return error
   - Expectations: Error logged, task returns error status, subscription still created

2. **Handles missing organization gracefully**
   - Setup: organizationId points to non-existent org
   - Expectations: Task throws with clear error message

3. **Handles database transaction failures**
   - Setup: Mock transaction to fail during data fetch
   - Expectations: Task fails cleanly, no partial email send

4. **Handles malformed payment method data**
   - Setup: paymentMethodData is not an object or missing last4
   - Expectations: Email sent with undefined last4, no crash

5. **Test environment safety**
   - Setup: Run in test environment (IS_TEST = true)
   - Expectations: Email logged but not actually sent

## 7. Test Data Factories

### Required Test Helpers
```typescript
// Test data factories needed
createTestCustomer()
createTestSubscription() 
createTestPrice()
createTestOrganization()
createTestPaymentMethod()
createTestCheckoutSession()

// Mock helpers
mockSafeSend()
mockAdminTransaction()
mockTriggerTask()
```

## 8. Performance & Load Tests

### Notification Performance

1. **Handles high volume of concurrent notifications**
   - Setup: Trigger 100 notifications simultaneously
   - Expectations: All complete within reasonable time, no deadlocks

2. **Respects Trigger.dev concurrency limits**
   - Setup: Queue more tasks than concurrency limit
   - Expectations: Tasks process at configured rate

## Test Execution Strategy

### Priority Order:
1. **Critical Path** (Must pass before deployment):
   - Email template rendering
   - Basic notification sending
   - Workflow integration
   - Upgrade metadata flow

2. **Important** (Should pass before deployment):
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
   - Idempotency

3. **Nice to Have** (Can be added post-deployment):
   - Performance tests
   - Load tests

### Test Coverage Goals:
- Email Templates: 100% branch coverage
- Trigger Tasks: 90% branch coverage
- Integration Points: 85% coverage
- Overall: 90% line coverage

## Mocking Strategy

### What to Mock:
- Resend email service (safeSend)
- Database transactions (for unit tests)
- Trigger.dev task execution
- External API calls

### What NOT to Mock:
- Data transformation logic
- Business logic conditions
- Template rendering logic
- Metadata flow

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests:
- New email fields added
- Notification conditions change
- Upgrade logic modified
- New subscription types added

### Test Documentation:
- Each test file should have clear descriptions
- Complex setup should be commented
- Share test utilities across test files
- Keep test data factories up to date
