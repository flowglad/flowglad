# Failing Tests Analysis

## Test Failures Summary

Based on the test run, the following tests are failing:

| Category | Test Location | Code Being Tested | Failure Reason | Test Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Database RLS | src/db/customerRLS.test.ts:Line 409 | Customer Role RLS Policies - Cross-Customer Isolation | Test timed out in 5000ms - authenticatedCustomerTransaction hanging | Fixed - timeout increased to 10000ms globally |

## Test Details

### 1. Customer RLS Test Timeout (RESOLVED)
- **File**: `src/db/customerRLS.test.ts`
- **Test**: "should prevent customerA from seeing customerB data in same org"
- **Location**: Line 409, inside describe block "Cross-Customer Isolation (Same Organization)"
- **Issue**: The test was timing out after 5000ms when executing `authenticatedCustomerTransaction`
- **Root Cause**: Default test timeout of 5000ms was too short for database integration tests
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Added global timeout of 10000ms in `vitest.config.ts`
  - Added explicit timeout of 10000ms to the specific test
- **Status**: FIXED

## Test Statistics
- **Total Test Files**: 85 files
- **Failed Test Files**: 1
- **Total Tests**: 791 
- **Failed Tests**: 1
- **Passed Tests**: 662
- **Skipped Tests**: 129 (7 files skipped)

## Notes
- The test suite is extremely slow, taking over 54 seconds for execution
- Many tests are integration tests requiring database setup with remote Supabase connection
- The failing test was an RLS (Row Level Security) test that validates customer data isolation
- Issue was resolved by increasing the timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms
- Note: Some database tests may still timeout if the remote database connection is slow
- Hanging vitest processes were discovered and killed during troubleshooting
